Booth Multiplier (Verilog)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements an 8-bit signed Booth multiplier in Verilog, capable of multiplying two signed integers and producing a 16-bit signed product.
It follows Booth's Algorithm for signed binary multiplication, which is efficient for hardware implementations as it reduces the number of addition/subtraction steps needed.

The design is fully modular, starting from basic gates, building up to full adders, adders, subtractors, and finally the Booth multiplication process.
